Identify the correct type (feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, chore, test) based on the code changes. Infer the relevant scope (e.g., nvim, i3, dotfiles, fastify) if applicable. Keep the title under 50 characters, using imperative mood. Wrap the body at 72 characters. Be concise: Clearly explain what changed and why in as few words as possible. List key changes in three or fewer bullet pointsâ€”only the most relevant details. If the commit introduces breaking changes, add ! after the type and include a BREAKING CHANGE: section at the end. Format as a gitcommit code block.'
